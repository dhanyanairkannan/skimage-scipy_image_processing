# skimage-scipy_image_processing
Performing image processing operations with skimage and scipy. Various image processing techniques were explored and used, such as grayscaling, adding Gaussian random noise, filtering a perturbed image with a Gaussian mask and applying a uniform smoothing mask, applying k-means segmentation to an image and performing Canny edge detection.

### Libraries Used
numpy
imageio
skimage
sklearn
matplotlib

### Image Processing
Run the image_processing.py file which uses the images from the image_data folder.


## Image output files

This image refers to the greyscale image of the avengers_imdb.jpg from the image_data folder, as required for Task 1 of Part 2.

### avengersb&w.png

This image refers to the black and white image of the avengers_imdb.jpg from the image_data folder, as required for Task 1 of Part 2.

### bush_house_Gaussian_mask.png

This image refers to the output image of the bush_house_wikipedia.jpg from the image_data folder, after adding Gaussian random noise, filtering the perturbed image with a Gaussian mask and applying a uniform smoothing mask, as required for Task 2 of Part 2.

### forest_k_means.png

This image refers to the output image of the forestry_commission_gov_uk.jpg from the image_data folder, after dividing the image into 5 segments using k-means segmentation, as required for Task 3 of Part 2.

### rolland_Hough.png

This image refers to the output image of the rolland_garros_tv5monde.jpg from the image_data folder, after performing Canny edge detection and applying Hough transform, as required for Task 4 of Part 2.
